# Break-RSA-Stat
This project aim to visulaize and study the statistics of different algorithm to break the RSA cryptosystem.

More than 14000 couples of private/public keys are generated . Then 5 differents breaking algorithm with different level of optimization are applied. 
This algorithm manage to discover the private key from the public one, finding the prime factors of the public keys. 
The peformance of this different breaking algorithms are compared to understand what is the most efficient.

This program was part of the course "Software for the Telecomunication" run by the professor Alessandro Guidotti.
